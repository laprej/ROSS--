ROSS--
------
Whereas ROSS was written (more or less) exclusively in C, ROSS-- aims to leverage many of the conveniences that C++ offers.
These may include:
* templates
* containers
* the STL
* inheritance
* boost
* anything else I may have missed

By taking advantage of the above, ideas can be developed and tested more quickly and in a reasonably performant manner.
